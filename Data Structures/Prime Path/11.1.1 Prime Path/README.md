Store the number of incoming test cases in a variable `testCases`.

1. List all numbers ranging from the min number to the max number.
2. Find all the primes in the range of the min number to the max number.
3. For each prime after the min number, compare the prime with the min number. If only one digit is changed, then the two primes are connected.
4. Add the prime to an array `connectedPrimes` if it is connected to the previous prime.
5. Calculate the length of the array `connectedPrimes`.
6. Print the length of the array `connectedPrimes`.
